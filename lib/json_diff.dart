/// A library for determining the difference between two JSON objects.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// In order to diff two JSON objects, stored as Dart strings, create a new
/// [JsonDiffer], passing the two objects:
///
///     JsonDiffer differ = new JsonDiffer(leftJsonString, rightJsonString)
///
/// To calculate the diff between the two objects, call `diff()` on the
/// [JsonDiffer], which will return a [DiffNode]:
///
///     DiffNode diff = differ.diff();
///
/// This [DiffNode] object is a hierarchical structure (like JSON) of the
/// differences between the two objects.
